# Angular Air Force Ranks


This [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) project was made to practice using the framework.  Enlisted Air Force ranks were chosen because they provided a clear catalog of items.




### Integration

CloudBees have provided a CI/deployment setup:

If you run this, you will get a cloned version of this repo to start working on in a private git repo, 
along with a CI service (in Jenkins) hosted that will run unit and end to end tests in both Firefox and Chrome.
